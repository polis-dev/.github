= Features Structure

Similar to the {official-repo} repo, this repository has a `src`
folder.  Each Feature has its own sub-folder, containing at least a
`devcontainer-feature.json` and an entrypoint script `install.sh`.

```
├── src
│   ├── hello
│   │   ├── devcontainer-feature.json
│   │   └── install.sh
│   ├── color
│   │   ├── devcontainer-feature.json
│   │   └── install.sh
|   ├── ...
│   │   ├── devcontainer-feature.json
│   │   └── install.sh
...
```

An {official-tools}[implementing tool] will composite properties from the
feature's `devcontainer-feature.json` file, and execute in the `install.sh`
entrypoint script in the container during build time.  Implementing tools are
also free to process attributes under the `customizations` property as desired.

=== Options

All available options for a Feature should be declared in the
`devcontainer-feature.json`.  The syntax for the `options` property can be found
in the {json-ref}.

For example, the `color` feature provides an enum of three possible options
(`red`, `gold`, `green`).  If no option is provided in a user's
`devcontainer.json`, the value is set to "red".

```jsonc
{
    // ...
    "options": {
        "favorite": {
            "type": "string",
            "enum": [
                "red",
                "gold",
                "green"
            ],
            "default": "red",
            "description": "Choose your favorite color."
        }
    }
}
```

Options are exported as Feature-scoped environment variables.  The option name
is captialized and sanitized according to {option-resolution}.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Activating feature 'color'"
echo "The provided favorite color is: ${FAVORITE}"

...
```

== Distributing Features

=== Versioning

Features are individually versioned by the `version` attribute in a Feature's `devcontainer-feature.json`.  Features are versioned according to the semver specification. More details can be found in the official {versioning} docs.

=== Publishing


NOTE: The Distribution spec can be found here: {json-ref}

NOTE: While any registry  that implements the {oci-distribution-spec} can be
used, this template will leverage GHCR (GitHub Container Registry) as the
backing registry.

Features are meant to be easily sharable units of dev container configuration and installation code.

This repo contains a GitHub Action [workflow](.github/workflows/release.yaml) that will publish each feature to GHCR.  By default, each Feature will be prefixed with the `<owner/<repo>` namespace.  For example, the two Features in this repository can be referenced in a `devcontainer.json` with:

```
ghcr.io/polis-dev/devc/color:1
ghcr.io/polis-dev/devc/hello:1
```

The provided GitHub Action will also publish a third "metadata" package with just the namespace, eg: `ghcr.io/devcontainers/feature-starter`.  This contains information useful for tools aiding in Feature discovery.

'`devcontainers/feature-starter`' is known as the feature collection namespace.

### Marking Feature Public

Note that by default, GHCR packages are marked as `private`.  To stay within the free tier, Features need to be marked as `public`.

This can be done by navigating to the Feature's "package settings" page in GHCR, and setting the visibility to 'public`.  The URL may look something like:

```
https://github.com/users/<owner>/packages/container/<repo>%2F<featureName>/settings
```

=== Adding Features to the Index

If you'd like your Features to appear in our {features-index} so that other
community members can find them, you can do the following:

* Go to {devcontainers-github-io} (the repo for {containers-dev}).
* Open a PR to modify the {devcontainer-collection-index} file.

This index is from where {supporting-tools} like {vscode-devcontainers} and {github-codespaces} surface Features for their dev container creation UI.

==== Using private Features in Codespaces

For any Features hosted in GHCR that are kept private, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` access token in your environment will need to have `package:read` and `contents:read` for the associated repository.

Many implementing tools use a broadly scoped access token and will work automatically.  GitHub Codespaces uses repo-scoped tokens, and therefore you'll need to add the permissions in `devcontainer.json`

An example `devcontainer.json` can be found below.

```jsonc
{
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu",
    "features": {
     "ghcr.io/polis-dev/devc/hello:1": {
            "greeting": "Hello"
        }
    },
    "customizations": {
        "codespaces": {
            "repositories": {
                "my-org/private-features": {
                    "permissions": {
                        "packages": "read",
                        "contents": "read"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
